We are together again.</p>\n<p>Speaking about identity — being at Readify had become a big part of mine.\nI was introduced as being from Readify when speaking at DDD Perth and Fenders,\nand I wore the polo like a uniform, like so many others at Readify.\nIt was a little scary to lose that,\nand I think it’s normal to be scared of changing your identity.\nBut all the things that I liked about Readify are still there.</p>\n<p>The perks are the same,\nthe work is the same\n(for now — joining forces opens some exciting new avenues),\nthe people are the same,\nand the shirts are coming!</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Becoming Telstra Purple","date":"September 14, 2019","description":"Readify is no more, having come together with a few other businesses and different parts of Telstra to form Telstra Purple, the largest Australian-owned technology services business.\nI'll give my thoughts on the changes, and why I'm excited for the future."},"fields":{"readingTime":{"text":"3 min read"}}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/becoming-telstra-purple/","previous":null,"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/ndc-sydney-2019/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"NDC Sydney 2019"}}}}}
