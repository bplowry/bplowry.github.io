Changing context from day-to-day,\nor multiple times per day isn’t always productive and can be overwhelming.\nBe the shield.</p>\n<p>You may need to be vulnerable:\nBe prepared to give away control.\nEmphasise that you’re learning, too.\nLet them fail and learn.\nRemember that it’s OK to not know.</p>\n<p>The challenge?\nLearn new tech, see how you can apply it.\nYou know, that’s cool.

You’d download the file and put it on the web server with FTP. Simple.</p>\n<p>Now we have</p>\n<ul>\n<li>CLIs (command line interfaces),</li>\n<li>transpilers,</li>\n<li>packages and package managers,</li>\n<li>bundlers,</li>\n<li>NodeJS.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>It’s a lot more complicated.</p>\n<p>The steps along the way:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code class=\"language-text\">&lt;script src=&quot;scripts/jQuery.js&quot; /&gt;</code>\nWe added a reference to the file we’d downloaded and put on the web server</li>\n<li>\n<code class=\"language-text\" style=\"word-break: break-all;\">\n&lt;script src=\"node_modules/jQuery/dist/jQuery.min.js\" /&gt;\n</code>\nWe could install dependencies with NPM\n</li>\n<li><code class=\"language-text\">require(&quot;jQuery&quot;)</code>\nCommonJS came around and we could install dependencies using <code class=\"language-text\">require</code></li>\n<li>2011: The first bundlers started appearing. Browserify was the main player.</li>\n<li>2015: Webpack comes along and quickly becomes the go-to (self: typical JavaScript)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Transpiling allows us to use syntax that isn’t supported in older browsers, e.g. turning <code class=\"language-text\">async/await</code> code into <code class=\"language-text\">.then</code> and <code class=\"language-text\">.catch</code>.</p>\n<p>Polyfills allow us to use functionality that isn’t natively supported in older browsers, e.g. ensuring that <code class=\"language-text\">Promise</code> is available in the browser.</p>\n<p>Together, these allow us to write “modern” code, so we don’t need to worry (as much) about browser differences.</p>\n<p>Script runners make all those CLI commands easier.\nFirst Grunt and Gulp, then NPM added <code class=\"language-text\">scripts</code>, and it’s become the standard.\nThe script runner lets you run <code class=\"language-text\">npm run build</code> rather than <code class=\"language-text\">./node_modules/bin/webpack webpack.config.js --production</code> or something else complicated.</p>\n<p>React, Vue, and Angular (the most-used web frameworks at time of writing) use all of these things under the hood.\nThey have CLI tools to create new projects following best practices.</p>\n<p><a href=\"#\">Back to top</a></p>\n<hr>\n<h2><a id=\"am-i-a-good-developer\"></a> Am I a Good Developer?</h2>\n<p>Emad Alashi <a href=\"https://twitter.com/@EmadAshi\">@EmadAshi</a></p>\n<p>Are you a good developer\nWe should understand one level below what we’re working on</p>\n<ul>\n<li>in a human pyramid, you don’t care about the bottom, only the layer you’re standing on</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Appetite to learn</p>\n<p><a href=\"#\">Back to top</a></p>\n<hr>\n<h2><a id=\"have-lunch-and-impact-on-your-company\"></a> Have lunch and impact on your company!</h2>\n<p>Nelly Sattari <a href=\"https://twitter.com/@nelly_sattari\">@nelly_sattari</a></p>\n<p>Brown bags or lunch and learn.

Anton showed a few wild examples:\na Perth unicyclist,\na Sydney Harbour swimmer\n… but more conventional options are available</p>\n<p>So he ran an experiment.\nLike all good experiments, he needed some rules:\nConsistent timing (door to desk),\nNo work or email on the commute,\nNothing infinite scrolling (e.g. Twitter, Facebook)</p>\n<p>Using an electric assisted bike (cheating) meant he didn’t get as sweaty, so didn’t need to change at either end.</p>\n<p>Anton considered the time and cost for driving, cycling, and public transport.</p>\n<p>You can probably guess that the car was the fastest mode,\nand cycling was the cheapest.\nMost investigations stop there, but Anton wanted to go deeper.</p>\n<p>A few notable bits:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>you can use the commute to learn (all modes allowed listening to podcasts),\nbut reading was restricted to public transport.\nWhen driving or cycling, you need to look where you’re going,\nand your hands are occupied. On a bus, you just need to keep an eye out for your stop.</li>\n<li>use the trip to plan your day, or separate work from home.</li>\n<li>cycling was more vigorous exercise, and for longer,\nbut public transport had some walking, which was better than driving, at least.</li>\n<li>Driving was awful for mental health. It’s stressful, there’s road rage.\nThe other modes allow stopping and looking around. Being in your body.</li>\n<li>Bike paths often go through parks, and are usually nicer to look at than roads.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>And the results?</p>\n<div style=\"max-width: 100%; overflow-x: auto;\">\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Category</th>\n<th>Driving</th>\n<th>Cycling</th>\n<th>Public transport</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Time</td>\n<td>🏆</td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Cost</td>\n<td></td>\n<td>🏆</td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Free time</td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td>🏆</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Health</td>\n<td></td>\n<td>🏆</td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Mental health</td>\n<td></td>\n<td>🏆</td>\n<td>🏆</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>View</td>\n<td></td>\n<td>🏆</td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Environment</td>\n<td></td>\n<td>🏆</td>\n<td>🏆</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Safety (no judgements made)</td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div>\n<p>So what does Anton do now?
