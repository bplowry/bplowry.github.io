description: "Readify is no more,
having come together with a few other businesses
and different parts of Telstra
to form Telstra Purple,
the largest Australian-owned technology services business.

I'll give my thoughts on the changes,
and why I'm excited for the future."

I started at Readify in 2017,
after my previous employer closed their Perth office.
I'd been a developer for just under a year
and in the software industry for just under 3 years.
I've had amazing opportunities for growth since starting at Readify.
We get 20 days per year of professional development time to learn new skills,
both technical and core skills.
I'm surrounded by smart and encouraging people who are always willing to help.
These learning opportunities were the biggest reason for me joining Readify in the first place.

Now Readify is part of [Telstra Purple](https://purple.telstra.com).
The Readify name will live on in our hearts and minds,
but not on paper.
The connections I'd built with the people around me,
and their reputation for delivering outcomes,
haven't gone anywhere.
Readify had a strong presence and reputation within the community,
and the task of everyone who's now a part of Telstra Purple
is to build that same reputation for the new name.
It's important to remember that the people haven't changed,
just the name on their shirts.

As Telstra Purple we can build stronger relationships with the people around us.
In WA, Readify has 50 or 60 people,
and Kloud -- a sister-company of sorts, also part of Telstra Purple -- has around 5.
We run a quarterly Back2Base in Readify,
but we wanted to include Kloud as well,
as part of our WA "fam".
So, rather than having "Readify Back2Base" and excluding the Kloudies,
it was just "Back2Base".
In trying to include more people, we'd actually lost some of our identity.
Earlier this month, we had our first Back2Base since becoming Telstra Purple,
and this time we _could_ use branding while remaining inclusive --
the Telstra Purple brand.
We are together again.

Readify had become part of my identity.
The polo was basically a uniform to me and many others.
It was a little scary to lose that,
and I think it's normal to be scared of changing your identity.
But all the things that I liked about Readify are still there.

The perks are the same,
the work is the same
(for now -- joining forces opens some exciting new avenues),
the people are the same,
and the shirts are coming!
